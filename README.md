# photo-recommender
A system that recommends photos based on previous photos you liked

This will be a horizontally-scalable version of https://github.com/euan-forrester/photo-recommender-poc, built to handle many users simultaneously.

I plan to use:
- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/ and https://aws.amazon.com/eks/ 
- Kafka: https://kafka.apache.org/ and https://aws.amazon.com/msk/
- Clickhouse: https://clickhouse.yandex/
- Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/
- Ansible: https://www.ansible.com/
- Random other parts of AWS like ElastiCache, Parameter Store, CloudWatch, and Centralized Logging
- Vue.js: https://vuejs.org/
